#' Average public opinion on gay rights (1999-2008)
#'
#' A dataset containing the estimated state-level support for gay rights policies using polling data from 1999 to 2008 and multilevel regression and post-stratification. This was done by \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055409990050}{Lax and Phillips (2009)} when they studied the relationship between state policy adoption and public opinion.
#'
#' The numbers are the percent of state citizens estimated to answer affirmatively (as opposed to negatively or not responding) to pro-gay rights questions. See the appendix of the original paper for more details.
